- There must be at least one corresponding author, and this must be a specific person with a valid email address
- Authors of papers from previous SciPys may change their name on their published work by contacting the Proceedings Co-chairs
- All citations that have DOIs should include those DOIs in the paper's references section, see [`mybib.bib`](./papers/myst_template/mybib.bib).
- All figures and tables should have captions.
- Figures and tables should be positioned close to their explanatory text.
- All abbreviations should be identified in your `myst.yml` ([docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/glossaries-and-terms#abbreviations))
- License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative Commons,

- Images and figures should be reasonably sized and formatted for viewing online; typically less than 1 MB
- The paper should be at most 6000 words including figures but not including references; this is about 8 pages for the published PDF.
